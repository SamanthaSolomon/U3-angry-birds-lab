So far, we've learned how to organize an Express app using MVC (**M**odel **C**ontroller **V**iews) format. Express has a lot of setup. It can become easy to get lost, especially once we start adding more controllers and models. Constructing everything in an organized way is **key** to keeping track of everything. Lets practice by creating an app from scratch!

## Setup

The only file that has been provided is the seed. The rest is up to you to make!

## Completion

Parts 1, 2.

## Assignment

### Part 1 - Set Up Your App

- Install and requuire any dependencies 
- Set up your file structure
    - Make the following directories:
        - `routes`
        - `controllers`
        - `models`
    - Create your `server.js` file
- Set up your `server.js` file. Require your packages, set up your app and view engine, and listen on your port. 

### Part 2 - Functionality

Below is a description of what your app should contain.  Figure out your process for constructing your app. Some start with the routes, others start with the model. Do what makes sense to you.

#### Models

Your model will handle the angry bird data. It should include these functions:
- `getAll()` - Will return all of the angry birds.
- `getById(id)` - Will return the angry bird with the inputed id.

#### Controllers

You will have 1 controller. It will handle all of the `/angry-birds` routes.
- When you go to `/angry-birds/` it should get all of the angry birds from the model and render the `angry-birds.ejs` view.
- When you go to `/angry-birds/:id` it should get that individual bird from the model and render the `angry-bird.ejs` view.


## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- Parts 1-2;
- Any errors have been recorded in `errors.md`
